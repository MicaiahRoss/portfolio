             <p>
                 I started marching at the White Sabers in 2024, and will be returning for the 2025 season. I've played tenors since 11th grade, and snare 9th and 10th. I plan on trying to marching WGI later in the future, with the possibility of DCI as well. 
             </p>
             <p>  I've also been playing drum set since 5th grade, and am currently in jazz band at Behrend, and am the president of The Nittany Blues Club. I also have played piano since 8th grade.

            <h2>Music Production</h2>
            <p>I have been producing music for around 4 1/2 years. I use Ableton Live, and make many genres, 
                but I primarily produce EDM and "rap" beats. If you go the gallery page, you can hear some of my work.<a href="https://bulletins.psu.edu/"></a> </p>
