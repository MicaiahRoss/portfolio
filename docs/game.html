            <h2>Overview - The Good Gardener</h2>
           
            <p>The game I chose is titled "The Good Gardener." This game is from a small indie developer, and it is available on itch.io. The artistic style initially drew me in, as it looked calming. The description of the game really drew me in as well, with the devloper saying how you play as a gardener growing plants for your nation's war effort.</p>

            <h2>Graphics and Sound</h2>
            
            <p>The art style is very painting and cartoonish like, with moderate detail. This helps the game feel more happy, the game just feels bright and very vibrant, which suites the game very well. Music is a big part of the game. One day there will be very simple and happy music, but the other day might have very low and ominous music, indicating something is approaching. The sound effects are overall detailed and put in place very well. For example, the watering can. As you water your plants, it empties, and inturn the sound gets lower in pitch, until it is empty. Once it's empty, if you pick it up or place it down, it sounds hollow, which is realistic to the real world. Towards the end of the game, sounds of gunfire apporach, this creates a very dramatic and ominous effect, because your not expecting that as a player in this game. </p>
