            <h3>Essay About Making the Website</h3>
        <p>Using GitHub is very different from using something such as WordPress. WordPress is more “user-friendly”, offering a lot of features, themes, and other things with ease of access, and little to no code. GitHub on the other hand, requires you to know how to develop a website with HTML, creating the entire thing from scratch, with no template. Ultimately, both platforms have their own strengths and weakness, catering to different skill levels and needs.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges using GitHub is the fact that you must know how to code. You must learn XML and know how to format, design, and develop the website by yourself; there are no templates. Personally, it was getting the website to look how I wanted it too to look. There’s not a set of premade parameters you can immediately access to change how your website looks; you must write the code for them. But with these disadvantages, there are also some advantages compared to WordPress. For instance, GitHub allows you to fully customize your website with almost no drawbacks. You can intricately do anything to your website if you know how to code it; the sky is the limit. </p>
        <p>Modifying the layout of the GitHub-based website is particularly challenging because it requires a strong understanding of coding. Even with the knowledge on how to code, it takes a lot of trial and error to get things right. The skills necessary are knowing how to code, being good at learning new skillsets, and being willing to fail and try again. I want to improve my ability to format my website better, making a cleaner appearance so it doesn’t look as “blocky”. Also, getting text, images, borders to go where I want them to, and even including some animations/transitions to create a more seamless experience. </p>
